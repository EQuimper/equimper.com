## Intro

2016 was a big year for me. First thing, I start coding the 6 January 2016 so today is my first full year finish. Coming from an Army background this was one of the biggest moves of my life. I've always done a physical job and this one we all know is really more technical. I found by coding every day in the year "Yes 365days last year I have touched my PC and coded" that I love that more and more.

When I started that was really hard to be sure this is more than a passion. I was really not that good and everything was too much for me. I things the facts I'm french and everything is English didn't help me either. So after 1 big month of using Html and CSS I jump on the Ruby On Rails part. I follow a lot of tutorial on the internet where I make a clone of some app like Pinterest, Twitter, Airbnb etc.

In April 2016 I know at this time I want to do a career. So I join a BootCamp call [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com). That's was one my best moved so far. I meet one of the best programmer and more than that he was my mentor. His name is [Ryan Lynch](https://github.com/shiftyp). This guy makes me understand the hard concept and make everything look easier. He pushes me on the Redux world and now I use that everywhere. Thank you, Ryan!

When I finish the boot camp I was struggling finding job. But I continue to work on my experience and continue to build stuff. At this time the only project has built was this little [app](http://equimper.github.io/streamingAppRedux/). That's wasn't enough so I continue to build and put the commitment into my learning. With the help of the Thinkful team, I found my first as a freelance developer where I have built a full-stack application using React, Redux, React-Native, Meteor, Node etc.

In end November, I get a job at Thinkful where I help people with the React-Redux part of the course. I really like that, I learn much more by teaching. I liked helping people and this is a place where I'm happy to help the student understand react and redux much more. I know where we struggle and that's why I think that give me a good idea how I can help them.

In December, I start to challenge myself a bit more. The first thing I created a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7R7bcH9-KEBDiGNP1mZnmw). This thing was something I have to think for a long time but with my bad English + my experience I wasn't sure that was a good idea. But finally I really liked it and this is something I want to put energy this year. The second thing I start to restream myself on [livecoding.tv](https://www.livecoding.tv/equimper/). I start to stream almost the first day of my journey of learning code. Now I grow up a good audience and I think that push myself a bit more than doing nothing.

One thing too I'm proud for this year was my commitment on [github](https://github.com/EQuimper). I contribute on some of the open source project.

One of my best choice this year was to challenge myself doing 12 apps in 12 weeks. Right now I have finished the first 3 apps.


1. [ShortNeed](http://www.shneed.com/)
2. [GiveMeThatIdea](https://givemethatidea.com/)
3. [React-Native Twitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy5r_gXRPaw&t=3s)

That challenge myself so much, I learn stuff with this challenge so quickly and now that pushed me some time on a place I never been.
