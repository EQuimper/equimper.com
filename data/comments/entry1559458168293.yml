  <p>Hi there,

  Thank you for great tutorial.

  I have one issue with test runner.</p>

  <p>The result of test is sandwich between migration up and migration down
  information which I don't need.

  Silent argument is passd to vowfile.js as well. This removes the list of
  migration files run. But doesn't hide other unnecessary information.</p>

  <p>const ace = require('@adonisjs/ace')

  await ace.call('migration:run', {}, { silent: true })

  await ace.call('migration:reset', {}, { silent: true })</p>

  <p>Thanks for advance.</p>
