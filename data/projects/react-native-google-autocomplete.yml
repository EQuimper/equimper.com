description: 'A react-native render props library to make google autocomplete work nicely with any design.'
text: "I've build this library cause the current one I was using came with his own ui. Yes it's possible to kind of custom it, but this is a bit painful. With this library, you can use any ui you want, the only think I do it's provided you props."
