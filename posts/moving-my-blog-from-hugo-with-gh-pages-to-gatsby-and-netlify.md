## Intro

Like everyone else who follow the web development news on Twitter I see lot of article about this thing call [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). This is a static site generator who use modern techs like Webpack, React and GraphQL. Lot of the post I see was about how the performance is awesome, how easy you can build a site and deploy it. Finally a big tweet I see lately was the fact then the Gatsby team receive a good amount of money and become a startup.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“£ BIG NEWS: Gatsby is officially a startup! Weâ€™re thrilled to announce a $3.8M seed round &amp; the formation of Gatsby Inc!<br><br>ðŸ’ª Weâ€™ve got big plans to make the Gatsby open-source ecosystem even more powerful:<a href="https://t.co/zyvLuUOXDB">https://t.co/zyvLuUOXDB</a></p>&mdash; Gatsby (@gatsbyjs) <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs/status/999684072501792768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

Also an other big thing I see on my feed was Netlify. This is kind of the de-facto way to deploy your Gatsby site. I like the fact then this is really simple to deploy with and also https came for free without any more effort.

## Why did I move?

So first thing my blog was on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) another static site generator but who use the [Golang](https://golang.org/) language. I was really happy with this tech. The thing was why use a language I don't really use everyday when Gatsby come with React and GraphQL. Two techs I use at my current job and also even teach it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7R7bcH9-KEBDiGNP1mZnmw).

Before doing the move, I search a lot on the web for tutorial about how use Gatsby, how the deploy go, how you do a query, how you create page and also if you can use all the React ecosystem.
