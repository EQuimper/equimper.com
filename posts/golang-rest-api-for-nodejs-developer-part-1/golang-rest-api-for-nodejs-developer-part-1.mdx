## Golang Rest API for NodeJS developer - Part 1

In part 1, we will set up the foundation of our project. First, make sure you do have Go v1.13 install. On Mac, I recommend using Homebrew for that.

### Go module init

First, create a folder where you will put the code for this project. Inside this folder run the command `go mod init todo` todo here will be the name of the project. In **NodeJS** we do `npm init`.

### Setup the db connection

In this project, we will use the library [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) so for that, we need to install it by running `go get github.com/go-pg/pg`. This will install the library and all the dependency.
Coming from a **NodeJS** background this is the equivalent of `npm install`. Create a folder called `postgres` in the root of your project and a file with the same name with go as the extension.

In this file, we will create a function New where the only job of this one is returning a **pointer** to a DB instance

```go
// postgres/postgres.go

package postgres

import (
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v9"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func New(opts *pg.Options) *pg.DB {
	db := pg.Connect(opts)

	return db
}
```

> I like to keep the root of the package the same name as the folder, It's a convention I like to follow and make life easier

### Setup the basic handlers/endpoint

Handlers will be like our controller ish stuff. This will be where the logic of the app are bound with the client, in this case, rest API.
We will also set up middlewares and bind them to the router instance. For the routing, we use [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) and we can install it with `go get github.com/go-chi/chi`.
I found `Chi` to be the best routing library in **Go**. The reason is first for me to look like Express who is the routing library I use each time in **NodeJS**.
Also, this library follows the signature of the standard library. And in the **Go** community this is something they want.


```go
// handlers/handlers.go

package handlers

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/go-chi/chi"
	"github.com/go-chi/chi/middleware"
)

type Server struct {

}

func setupMiddleware(r *chi.Mux) {
	r.Use(middleware.RequestID)
	r.Use(middleware.RealIP)
	r.Use(middleware.Compress(6, "application/json"))
	r.Use(middleware.Logger)
	r.Use(middleware.Recoverer)
	r.Use(middleware.URLFormat)
	r.Use(middleware.Timeout(60 * time.Second))
}

func NewServer() *Server {
	return &Server{}
}

func SetupRouter() *chi.Mux {
	server := NewServer()

	r := chi.NewRouter()

	setupMiddleware(r)

	server.setupEndpoints(r)

	return r
}
```

After this, we want some base endpoint. For this part-1 we will make just the barebone of it.

```go
// handlers/endpoint.go

package handlers

import "github.com/go-chi/chi"

func (s *Server) setupEndpoints(r *chi.Mux) {
	r.Route("/api/v1", func(r chi.Router) {
		r.Route("/users", func(r chi.Router) {

		})
	})
}
```

### Setup the Main function

In **Go** everything starts from the Main function. So in our, we will finally initialize the database plus the routing.
We also gonna make sure the router is running on a certain port. We check if the env variables provide a `PORT` variables else we use `8081`.
This is the equivalent in **NodeJS** of

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 8081;
```

So create a file `main.go` in the root of the project and this should look like this.

```go
// main.go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v9"

	"todo/handlers"
	"todo/postgres"
)

func main() {
	DB := postgres.New(&pg.Options{
		User:     "postgres",
		Password: "postgres",
		Database: "todo_dev",
	})

	defer DB.Close()

	r := handlers.SetupRouter()

	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	if port == "" {
		port = "8081"
	}

	err := http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%s", port), r)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("cannot start server %v", err)
	}
}

```
