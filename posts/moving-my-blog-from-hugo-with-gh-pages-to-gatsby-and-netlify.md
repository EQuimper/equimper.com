## Intro

Like everyone else who follow the web development news on Twitter, I see lot of articles about this thing call [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). This is a static site generator who use modern techs like Webpack, React and GraphQL. Lot of the post I see about it was about how the performance is awesome, how easy you can build a site and deploy it. Finally a big tweet I see lately was the fact then the Gatsby team receive a good amount of money "3.8m" and become a startup.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“£ BIG NEWS: Gatsby is officially a startup! Weâ€™re thrilled to announce a $3.8M seed round &amp; the formation of Gatsby Inc!<br><br>ðŸ’ª Weâ€™ve got big plans to make the Gatsby open-source ecosystem even more powerful:<a href="https://t.co/zyvLuUOXDB">https://t.co/zyvLuUOXDB</a></p>&mdash; Gatsby (@gatsbyjs) <a href="https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs/status/999684072501792768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

How not be excited about this ðŸ˜€. 

Also another big thing I see on my feed was [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This is kind of the de-facto way to deploy your Gatsby site. I like the fact then this is really simple to deploy with and also https came for free without any more effort.

The stack of this blog

- Gatsby -> Static site generator
- Netlify -> Hosting
- Netlify CMS -> CMS who live in my github
- React-Emotion -> CSS in JS solution
- Tailwind Css -> CSS utility library
- Staticman -> Git based comment system
- Formik -> Managing state for the subscribe and the comment/reply form
- Serverless framework -> Subscribe user to Mailchimp

## Why did I move?

So first thing my blog was on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), another static site generator on [Golang](https://golang.org/). I was really happy with this tech. The thing who make me want to go away was why use a language I don't really use everyday when Gatsby come with React and GraphQL. Two techs I use at my current job and also even teach it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7R7bcH9-KEBDiGNP1mZnmw).

Before doing the move, I search a lot on the web for tutorial about how to get started with Gatsby, how to deploy, how the query work, how can you create a page and also if you can use all the React ecosystem. All my questions was really simple to get answer just by looking at all the great documentation from the [Gatsby site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/). They don't let you go all in with this without teaching you how to use their product, this is a big plus for me.

Because it's open source, a lot of library call plugin are create by the community to leverage the ecosystem. Example you want to use markdown? [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark) is there for you. You search for better performance for you images? [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image) is an awesome plugin for this. As you can see, almost everything you can ask for you site you can get it with a plugin. "You can still use almost all the library you use in your regular react app ðŸ˜€, but search for a plugin first ðŸ˜€"

Also one thing I told myself was, hey this is my blog, I'm the client of it, this is my product this is not even something I would want to make money with. Why not go crazy and use the tech I always want to try and see how that go. No customer who wait the product to get release.

## Create my own CMS or use a new tool for this ?

In my other blog I was writing the markdown post right from my text editor. Was great, I mean for a developer this is like you do everyday. But I feel like I don't wrote as many post I want because the experience is not so great.

I was reading a lot about headless CMS, like [Contentful](https://contentful.com/) or [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). Really like the idea about it. I even create this blog with this tool first. But one night I was watching some video on youtube and see this one.

This talk really sell me Netlify CMS. I mean first I already want to use Netlify for the deployment, second I want to be able to customize all my experience with it, and finally I don't want to pay for something I can handle for free in my text editor.

So I give it a chance, I navigated to their [website](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and follow the docs about how to setup it. Because I know Gatsby build lot of awesome plugin I try to search if one exist to make my life even easier to install it. And yes ðŸ˜€I found this plugin call [gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms). Just with a simple file with less than 20 line you can setup a CMS for creating blog post or anything you want. This is really awesome. One thing, this is free and you don't need to pay for storage or anything. Here all the stuff we build go to git and all is manage in git. Only thing, you need to use one of the 3 main git hosting provider.


- Github

- Gitlab

- Bitbucket

One of your question question maybe is ok so everything manage in git ok, but why ? This is a really good question. First, this is really easy to follow the project, all in one place. Also here by using nothing else than static markup we gain lot of security. We don't need to hit a database etc.
