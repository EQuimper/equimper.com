## Intro

Flutter has so many widgets, they are all so awesome, you have one for almost everything.
I really like that, this lets you create your app so much faster, and you have less code to write.
Less code less bug :) But sometimes, in Flutter, I find stuff pretty hidden, I mean the docs are really really great.
But in the case I want to show here, I was quite confused about how I will use this.

## Dismissed the keyboard.

So for those coming from react-native, we can use the component [react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view) who follow the input and also handle the dismiss of the keyboard.
Love this package, but at the same time, I ask myself why this one is not built in. I know you have the [KeyboardAvoidingView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/keyboardavoidingview) but it's
not the same quality as this community package. For dismissing a keyboard programmatically, we can do

```js
Keyboard.dismiss()
```

Easy enough. I like this. Now time to see how to do this in Flutter.

In Flutter, the keyboard will follow with the input, at least in android. It's pretty nice, so no need to have a third-party library or doing any effort to have this keyboard not showing on top of the input.
But the thing is how can I dismiss the keyboard. Yes, it's not already built. 
So what I found is that. **PS** I don't know if this is the best solution but for my case, it's work pretty good.

```dart
return GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    // Dismiss keyboard on outside tap
    FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(new FocusNode());
  },
  child: Scaffold(
    body: SingleChildScrollView(
      child: Container(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

As you can see I wrap the full `Scaffold` widget with a `GestureDetector` and I check for the `onTap` event. 
When press I can then request the focus on something else.
This way I can dismiss the keyboard. 
Not as straight forward as react-native but not that bad.

## Close the ModalBottomSheet

Flutter give us for free an awesome `ModalBottomSheet` who can be used to help a user see action at the bottom of the screen. 
I love this thing so much. If you want to show this to the user you only need to call `showModalBottomSheet` and that's it.

```dart
_onFabPress(BuildContext context) {
  showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return SafeArea(
        child: Container(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
            children: <Widget>[
              new ListTile(
                leading: Icon(Icons.directions_run),
                title: Text('New Workout'),
                onTap: () {
                  Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (BuildContext context) {
                        return WorkoutScreen(
                          workout: WorkoutModel(
                            title: 'New Workout',
                            date: DateTime.now(),
                          ),
                        );
                      },
                    ),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    });
}
```

Here I can show the modal with 1 list tile. The modal will then dismiss on outside press, can be swipe down etc. But if use this like that, when I click on an item and open a new screen, and after I go back the modal will still open.
I need to implicitly tell the navigation to dismiss this one. How can I do this? Pretty easy, I just added `Navigator.pop(context);` before the navigation inside the `onTap()`

```dart
_onFabPress(BuildContext context) {
  showModalBottomSheet(
    context: context,
    builder: (BuildContext context) {
      return SafeArea(
        child: Container(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
            children: <Widget>[
              new ListTile(
                leading: Icon(Icons.directions_run),
                title: Text('New Workout'),
                onTap: () {
                  // This will dismiss the modal
                  Navigator.pop(context);
                  Navigator.push(
                    context,
                    MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (BuildContext context) {
                        return WorkoutScreen(
                          workout: WorkoutModel(
                            title: 'New Workout',
                            date: DateTime.now(),
                          ),
                        );
                      },
                    ),
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    });
}
```

## End word

Right now, I really liked Flutter, I'm building my first real app with this and just wow. So many great things. 
Yes is not all Pros, I have some Cons.
Lot of them is because I know how to make it in react-native and need to search a lot for the Flutter version. 
But at the same time, so many thing are much easier.

Hope you enjoy.

Happy Coding :)
