## Golang Rest API for NodeJS developer - Intro

In the past few months, I've been working on some Golang projects. Loving it, but did get some issues. One of them is the lack of tutorials.
I mean you can find a lot of Golang tutorials online like on Youtube or Udemy etc.
But I didn't find one where I can learn how to build a full rest API or something like that.
A lot of them were just about Golang in general. Some about Golang as a full-stack solution, so you use Golang as the templating etc.
But didn't find one focussing on making Rest API.

#### What this tutorial will teach?

So this tutorial will be about making a Rest API but from a NodeJS developer perspective. This is a tutorial for those coming from the stack I was already showing in my channel. Those who use express etc.
We will learn how to make endpoint using [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), how to use postgresql as the database. How to use [go-pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) as the orm. Also how to deal with user authentication and JWT. How
to hash and save a password etc. The basic yes, but enough so you can build a project after this tutorial. The repos will be available [here](http://bit.ly/2qMyrBj) and the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzQWIQOqeUSPFPVfticl-CsmUv82Gb5W-).

> I'm not saying what I show will be better than others, but I feel this tutorial can fill a gap I get when coming to Golang

#### Conclusion

I hope you will enjoy this tutorial, let me know in the comments if you have any question

P.S If I see people like Golang tutorial on my youtube channel, I'm planning to make one for GraphQL + Golang after
