#### Intro

Iâ€™m from Quebec, a city in the beautiful country call Canada. My current position it's **Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer** at [AppAndFlow](https://appandflow.com/). I work mainly with this techs

- Golang
- Javascript
- React
- React-Native
- NodeJS
- Laravel
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Vue

Iâ€™ve been doing this for more than 5 years now. Before that, I was in the Canadian Forces. I also work at [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) and [Bloc](https://bloc.io) where I am a mentor who helps student getting into the web development industry.

Besides that, I own a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7R7bcH9-KEBDiGNP1mZnmw) where I teach web development. I try my best to give a good insight into how I think about working with certain problems. I help then getting into Javascript as well with server-side stuff.

When I'm not working I still code some of my personal projects. Programming is more than just a work for me, this is a hobby, it's a **passion**. But if I'm not in front of a computer I pass all my time with my beautiful fiance and our two dogs. At the end of the year, a small little person will joins the family ðŸ˜ƒ.

#### Why having this blog?

This blog is a place for me to write down what I think. This helps me first with my English who is not my native language, and that also help me empty my brain. By doing this I hope I can help people with some of the thinking, tutorial or whatever stuff I wrote here.
