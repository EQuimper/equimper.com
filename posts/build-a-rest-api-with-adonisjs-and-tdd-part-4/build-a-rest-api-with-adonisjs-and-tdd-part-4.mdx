## Intro

In this part number 4, we will continue working on our API. But now we will also make a request to another service call [TheMovieDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org).
This is finally an API where we can get info about a certain movie. In this part, we will create a new controller where the user will able to search
for a certain movie title. We first check if the movie already exists in our database. If not we then query the 3rd party API to get the info. When we got
that info we will persist them in our own database.

First, we will create a test call `SearchMovie` this will be another functional one.

```
adonis make:test SearchMovie
```

The first few tests will be just about the fact those movies are already inside our
database. This will make this simpler. Later for the test, we will mock **TheMovieDB**
so this way we will not exceed our request quotas.

```js
// test/functional/search-movie.spec.js

'use strict'

const Factory = use('Factory')
const { test, trait } = use('Test/Suite')('Search Movie')

trait('Test/ApiClient')
trait('Auth/Client')

test('can query for a certain movie title', async ({ assert, client }) => {
  await Factory.model('App/Models/Movie').create({ title: 'Joker' })

  const response = await client.get('/api/movies?title=Joker').end();

  response.assertStatus(200)
  response.assertJSONSubset([{
    title: 'Joker',
  }])
})
```

If you run the test you will get an error like this

```
can query for a certain movie title
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    at Factory.model
```

This means we didn't define yet our factory for the movie.

```js {34-39}
// database/factory.js

'use strict'

/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Factory
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Factories are used to define blueprints for database tables or Lucid
| models. Later you can use these blueprints to seed your database
| with dummy data.
|
*/

/** @type {import('@adonisjs/lucid/src/Factory')} */
const Factory = use('Factory')

Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', faker => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    email: faker.email(),
    password: 'password123'
  }
})

Factory.blueprint('App/Models/Challenge', faker => {
  return {
    title: faker.sentence(),
    description: faker.sentence()
  }
})

Factory.blueprint('App/Models/Movie', (faker, index, data) => {
  return {
    title: faker.sentence(),
    ...data
  }
})
```

If you check, the factory take 3 arguments and the third one is for getting data from when you call the factory. So you can overide value just like that.

If you rerun the test with `npm t` you will get now a new error. This error is about the fact then we
do not have yet a model `Movie` and our factory tries to create one with it. For this run the command

```
adonis make:model Movie -m
```

If you remember the `-m` means give me a migration file at the same time. We will just win some time with this.

Now the test will show this

```
Error: SQLITE_ERROR: table movies has no column named title
```

Pretty self explain the error, we try to add a title to but no column yet is defined. Time to add this to the migration file we just did create.

```js {11}
'use strict'

/** @type {import('@adonisjs/lucid/src/Schema')} */
const Schema = use('Schema')

class MovieSchema extends Schema {
  up () {
    this.create('movies', (table) => {
      table.increments()

      table.string('title').notNullable()

      table.timestamps()
    })
  }

  down () {
    this.drop('movies')
  }
}

module.exports = MovieSchema
```

After this we get

```
expected 404 to equal 200
404 => 200
```

Normal the route is not created yet. Add this to your `routes.js` file

```js
// start/routes.js

Route.group(() => {
  Route.get('/', 'MovieController.index')
}).prefix('/api/movies')
```

Now almost the same error but if you check carefully you will see now the error is about a `500` error not `404` like before. It's because the controller does not exist yet.

Time to make an **HTTP** controller

```
adonis make:controller Movie
```

Ooooh, same error? Yes, we did use a method called `index` but our controller is empty.

```js {6-8}
// app/Controllers/Http/MovieController.js

'use strict'

class MovieController {
  async index({}) {

  }
}

module.exports = MovieController
```

It's time now to do some stuff to fix the new error about `204` for `no-content`.
We first need to get the query title and after this fetch our database with this and return that with a `200` status code.

```js {8-14}
// app/Controllers/Http/MovieController.js

'use strict'

const Movie = use('App/Models/Movie')

class MovieController {
  async index({ request, response }) {
    const movies = await Movie.query()
      .where('title', request.input('title'))
      .fetch()

    return response.ok(movies)
  }
}

module.exports = MovieController
```

The input method in the request object gives us a way to fetch the query argument we want. In this case that was the title where we did put `Joker` in it. If you run your test at this point this will work.
But... I don't like that. First, in this way of doing, we need a match of 100% the title. What happens if the user just put `jok` and not the full `Joker` title. Time to create a new test for this case.

```js
test('can query with a subset of the title', async ({ assert, client }) => {
  await Factory.model('App/Models/Movie').create({ title: 'Joker' })

  const response = await client.get('/api/movies?title=jok').end();

  response.assertStatus(200)
  response.assertJSONSubset([{
    title: 'Joker',
  }])
})
```

Now when you run the test we see that fail. Time to make use of a real query search

```js {9,12}
// app/Controllers/Http/MovieController.js

'use strict'

const Movie = use('App/Models/Movie')

class MovieController {
  async index({ request, response }) {
    const title = request.input('title')

    const movies = await Movie.query()
      .where('title', 'LIKE', `%${title}%`)
      .fetch()

    return response.ok(movies)
  }
}

module.exports = MovieController
```

Now this works with this change. This will make sure if a subset of the title is present at least we still give the movie to the user.

Time to force the user to provide a title pretty simple one here too

```js
test('should throw 400 if no title is pass', async ({ assert, client }) => {
  const response = await client.get('/api/movies').end()

  response.assertStatus(400)
})
```

```js {11-13}
// app/Controllers/Http/MovieController.js

'use strict'

const Movie = use('App/Models/Movie')

class MovieController {
  async index({ request, response }) {
    const title = request.input('title')

    if (!title) {
      return response.status(400).json({ error: 'title is required' })
    }

    const movies = await Movie.query()
      .where('title', 'LIKE', `%${title}%`)
      .fetch()

    return response.ok(movies)
  }
}

module.exports = MovieController
```

## Conclusion

In the next part, we will jump on the `TheMovieDB` API stuff. We will learn how we can mock an external API so it's easier to test.
